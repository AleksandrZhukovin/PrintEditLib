# Print Edit Lib *(this is temporary name)*
## Objective
The decision of cresting this lib is motivated by the following:
- Integrate it in my pet-project of clothes store with fuctionality of
creating your own styles
- Learning JavaScript, TypeScript and getting experience of creating my own
packages

Of course it will be awsome if someone will find it useful.

## Description
This package gives you very small but in the same time perfect for certain 
problems functionality. The main idea is to allow user place his own prints
on the different pieces of clothes. But, of course, it is not limited with
only clothes and prints. You can place two images (one as static background, one as movable and scalable on top of background). 
The future goals are:
- Automaticly clip movable image so it does not go beyond the back object (for example, clip print when some of it's part goes beyound the t-shirt, so it can be placed on the edge with only some of it's part)
- Automaticly Clip background image so only the main object (for example, t-shirt) is on it (remove unneeded space from image)
